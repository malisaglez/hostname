# hostnames
In the hostname repository, we create a dataset using an algorithm where we generate 1500 hostnames with
the parameters we have previously established, thanks to the random library. 

We use four types of graphics to illustrate our results:
  1. A grouped bar chart by country, where we analyze how many countries use the four different operating systems.
  2. A pie chart where we present the total number of operating systems, grouped by type.
  3. A bar chart that presents the total number of hosts by country.
  4. A bar chart that presents the total hosts by country, grouped by environment.
